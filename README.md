# PAC-MAN 2017

Guide PAC-MAN through this classic maze as you consume pellets, chase ghosts, and collect fruits. Consume all the pellets to advance to the next stage. Munch on a Power Pellet to temporarily allow ghosts to be eaten. But be carefulâ€”Blinky, Inky, Pinky, and Clyde adapt quickly to survive.

Built using Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) and modeled after the original PAC-MAN arcade game, this version features a combination of modified graphics, custom animations, a unique pause menu, and original gameplay.
