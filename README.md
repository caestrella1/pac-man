# PAC-MAN 2017

Guide PAC-MAN through this classic maze as you consume pellets, chase ghosts, and collect fruits. Consume all the pellets to advance to the next stage. Munch on a Power Pellet to temporarily allow ghosts to be eaten. But be carefulâ€”Blinky, Inky, Pinky, and Clyde adapt quickly to survive.

Built using Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) and modeled after the original PAC-MAN arcade game, this version features a combination of modified graphics, custom animations, a unique pause menu, and original gameplay.

# Credits
- Animation and AnimatedSprite classes created by Maximilian Wagenbach (Foaly).
- Collision detection by Nick Koirala (original version) and ahnonay (SFML2 compatibility).

# Known Issues
- Characters sometimes wander off the grid (especially the ghosts)
- Ghosts move randomly (Algorithm will eventually be implemented).
